    <!-- Accessibility Service Description -->
    <string name="accessibility_service_description">
        Second Chance uses accessibility services to monitor and block access to apps that may trigger relapse during recovery.
        
        How it works:
        ‚Ä¢ Detects when you try to open monitored apps (like Snapchat, Telegram)
        ‚Ä¢ Shows a supportive blocking screen instead of allowing access
        ‚Ä¢ Sends permission requests to your recovery admin
        ‚Ä¢ Helps you stay strong during moments of weakness
        
        Privacy & Security:
        ‚Ä¢ Only monitors specific apps you choose to block
        ‚Ä¢ Does not read or store personal messages or content
        ‚Ä¢ All monitoring happens locally on your device
        ‚Ä¢ Your recovery admin only receives permission requests, not personal data
        
        This service is essential for Second Chance to provide effective recovery support. You can disable it anytime through Android Settings ‚Üí Accessibility.

    <!-- Device Admin Description -->
    <string name="device_admin_description">
        Second Chance needs device administrator privileges to protect your recovery progress.
        
        This prevents:
        ‚Ä¢ Uninstalling the app during moments of weakness
        ‚Ä¢ Bypassing protection by removing the app
        ‚Ä¢ Disabling monitoring without proper authorization
        
        Your recovery admin will be notified if someone tries to remove these protections.
