# Security Audit Report - SecondChance Application
**Date:** September 16, 2025
**Auditor:** System Security Review
**Scope:** Sensitive Data Handling, Authentication, and Recovery Data Protection

## Executive Summary
This security audit evaluates the SecondChance application's handling of sensitive health data, recovery information, and user authentication. The application is designed for addiction recovery support with master-client relationships.

## Critical Findings

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **Hardcoded JWT Secret in Production Code**
   - **Location:** `server/routes/auth.js:8`
   - **Issue:** JWT secret defaults to a hardcoded value if environment variable not set
   - **Risk:** Token forgery, unauthorized access
   - **Recommendation:** Require JWT_SECRET from environment, fail if not provided

2. **Sensitive Data in localStorage**
   - **Location:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:46-47, 93-94, 130-131`
   - **Issue:** JWT tokens and user data stored in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS)
   - **Risk:** Token theft via client-side attacks
   - **Recommendation:** Use httpOnly cookies for tokens, implement CSRF protection

3. **No Data Encryption at Rest**
   - **Location:** `server/database/init.js`
   - **Issue:** SQLite database stores sensitive recovery data without encryption
   - **Risk:** Data exposure if database file is compromised
   - **Recommendation:** Implement database encryption, encrypt sensitive fields

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

4. **Insufficient Input Validation**
   - **Location:** `server/routes/auth.js:14-35`
   - **Issue:** Basic validation only, no sanitization of user inputs
   - **Risk:** SQL injection, XSS attacks
   - **Recommendation:** Add input sanitization, use parameterized queries consistently

5. **Crisis Event Logging Contains PII**
   - **Location:** `server/database/init.js:113-125`
   - **Issue:** IP addresses and location data stored with crisis events
   - **Risk:** Privacy violation, tracking of vulnerable individuals
   - **Recommendation:** Hash or anonymize location data, implement data retention policies

6. **No Rate Limiting on Crisis Endpoints**
   - **Location:** `src/pages/CrisisPage.tsx:76-90`
   - **Issue:** Crisis resource access not rate-limited
   - **Risk:** Abuse of emergency services, DOS attacks
   - **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting with bypass for genuine emergencies

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

7. **Console Logging of Sensitive Operations**
   - **Location:** Multiple files
   - **Issue:** Authentication events logged to console
   - **Risk:** Information disclosure in production logs
   - **Recommendation:** Use structured logging, disable verbose logging in production

8. **Missing Security Headers**
   - **Issue:** No evidence of security headers configuration
   - **Risk:** Various client-side attacks
   - **Recommendation:** Implement CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options

## Data Privacy Concerns

### Personal Health Information (PHI)
- **Recovery progress tracking** stores addiction-related metrics
- **Crisis events** log mental health emergencies
- **App monitoring** reveals behavioral patterns
- **Recommendation:** Implement HIPAA-compliant data handling if operating in US

### GDPR Compliance (EU/UK)
- No clear data deletion mechanism
- Missing privacy policy implementation
- No user consent tracking
- **Recommendation:** Implement right to erasure, explicit consent flows

## Authentication & Authorization

### Strengths
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Role-based access control (master/client)
- Token expiration (7 days)

### Weaknesses
- No multi-factor authentication
- No session invalidation on password change
- Token refresh mechanism vulnerable to replay attacks

## Recommendations Priority List

### Immediate Actions (Within 24 hours)
1. Remove hardcoded JWT secret
2. Move tokens from localStorage to httpOnly cookies
3. Implement CSRF protection
4. Add rate limiting to all API endpoints

### Short-term (Within 1 week)
1. Encrypt database at rest
2. Implement proper input sanitization
3. Add security headers
4. Create data retention policies
5. Implement audit logging

### Long-term (Within 1 month)
1. Add multi-factor authentication
2. Implement end-to-end encryption for messages
3. Regular security testing pipeline
4. Third-party security audit
5. Compliance certification (HIPAA/GDPR)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Penetration Testing**: Focus on authentication bypass, XSS, SQL injection
2. **Data Leakage Testing**: Check for sensitive data in logs, API responses
3. **Load Testing**: Crisis mode activation under stress
4. **Compliance Audit**: HIPAA/GDPR requirements

## Conclusion

The SecondChance application handles extremely sensitive recovery and mental health data. While basic security measures are in place, significant improvements are needed to protect vulnerable users. The identified high-priority issues should be addressed immediately before any production deployment.

**Risk Level: HIGH**
**Production Readiness: NOT RECOMMENDED** until critical issues are resolved
